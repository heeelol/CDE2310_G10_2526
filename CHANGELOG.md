## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-20

Complete architectural refactor: Independent `auto_explore` mission control system with modular ROS2 launch architecture, proper package discovery, and updated documentation.

### Added
- feat(architecture): Create independent `auto_explore` mission control system with zero external imports
- feat(launch): Implement modular launch architecture with 3 components (nav_bringup, global_controller_bringup, global_bringup)
- feat(fsm): Port FSM state machine from legacy implementation to `mission_controller.py`
- feat(navigation): Port frontier-based exploration algorithm from legacy to `exploration_controller.py`
- feat(markers): Port ArUco marker detection from legacy to `pose_publisher.py`
- feat(markers): Port marker logging system from legacy to `pose_subscriber.py`
- feat(config): Create local `config/params.yaml` for exploration parameter tuning (lookahead_distance, speed, expansion_size, target_error, robot_r)
- feat(package): Implement proper ROS2 ament_python package structure with correct buildtool_depend and export section
- fix(discovery): Fix package discovery issue by removing redundant exec_depend entries and setting packages=[package_name] in setup.py
- docs(README): Update README.md with clear Gazebo and physical robot launch sequences
- docs(README): Update installation instructions for `auto_explore` package
- docs(README): Keep legacy instructions for `autonomous_exploration` package for reference

### Changed
- Refactored entire mission control system from nested repository structure to independent package
- Updated package discovery mechanism to use ROS2 standard conventions
- Cleaned up XML validation issues in package.xml

### Fixed
- Fixed package discovery: Changed from `(python)` to `(ros.ament_python)` type
- Fixed XML parsing errors in package.xml by removing mixed depend/exec_depend entries
- Fixed launch wrapper script dependency by properly registering package with ROS2

### Removed
- Removed wrapper script dependency (`launch_auto_explore.sh`) - now uses direct `ros2 launch` command
- Removed redundant exec_depend entries from package.xml
- Cleaned up orphaned RViz configuration files

### Technical Details
- **Package Name:** `auto_explore`
- **Build System:** ament_python
- **ROS2 Version:** Humble
- **Python Version:** 3.x
- **Key Dependencies:** rclpy, geometry_msgs, sensor_msgs, nav_msgs, std_msgs, cv_bridge, opencv-python, pyyaml, slam_toolbox, rviz2
